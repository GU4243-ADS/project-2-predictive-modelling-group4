# Project 2: Predictive Modelling

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.<br />

In this directory, there should be a 'pets' folder with folders for 'train' and 'test' within, as well as the 'train_label.txt' file inside as well. <br />
The zipcode folder is part of another example code. It is not necessary.
