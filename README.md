### [Project Description](doc/)

Term: Spring 2018

+ Project title: Dogs Rule
+ Team Number: 4
+ Team Members: Richard, Xiangyu, Cindy, Shan, Minzi
+ Project summary: Given a training dataset of 1000 dog and 1000 cat pictures, our group was able to extract features from these training images. We then created a model which uses deep learning for image classification.
